I fell into web development at an unfortunate moment of my life: back in 2015, as I was about to graduate my Master's in Management from [Toulouse Business School](https://www.tbs-education.com/programs/master-degrees/). Writing some basic HTML and CSS was enough to mess with my mind, in a good way, and question my initial career plans.

As I was about to move to Paris to start looking for my first business position, my dad told me that he got diagnosed with cancer, and a bad one. I put my career plans on hold and moved back to my hometown to help him through his treatment.

I ended up having a lot of time on my hand, so I kept learning about web technologies for hours a day. Thanks [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) for the free education! I was fascinated by the fact that I could build anything I wanted, with little to no money, without anyone's permission and from anywhere in the world. Very different from the corporate world I was about to enter.

I was lucky enough to attend one of the first sessions of [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/web-development-course), a coding school in France. It was the most challenging and rewarding course of my life. I never thought my brain could digest so much knowledge in such a short amount of time. By the end, I knew enough to build my own ideas, and other people's too.

Around the same time, a great friend of mine was launching one of the first coworking caf√©s in France, [Hubsy](/projects/hubsy). He needed an app to manage bookings, I needed a project to work on, a match made in heaven. This first successful project got enough exposure among Hubsy's clients that I started getting requests from entrepreneurs. Before I knew it, I was a freelance web developer.

And I haven't stopped since:

- I've designed and built websites and apps for 20+ clients, all the while working remotely from places around the world. You can see all about it on the `/projects` [page](/projects).
- I've worked with [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/) as a teacher countless times, in France, China, Australia and Canada. I even launched their first campus in Sydney, Australia!
- I co-founded a Saas company, [Syncly](/projects/syncly), and lead the development of the product for 2 years, before we decided to shut it down.
- I've launched a few side projects with good friends in the tech space, like [Lottie Studio](/projects/lottie-studio), a design studio powered by [Lottie](https://airbnb.design/lottie/), an really cool open-source animation library.
- Actually, I did stop, for about 4 months in 2022. Working with computers didn't turn me into a robot, it turns out, and that I need to take care of myself, after two intense years of running Syncly and long Covid lockdowns.

I have now been building on the web for nearly a decade, which blows my mind as I'm writing these lines. A few years down the road, I decided to specialise in frontend and design, the areas of the stack I enjoy the most, but I still consider myself a fullstack developer. I've listed my tools of choice on the `/uses` [page](/uses).

If you feel like I would be a good match for your project, I would love to hear from you and see how I can help. Get in touch!
