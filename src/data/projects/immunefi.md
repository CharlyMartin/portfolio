## Context

Immunefi is the leading web3 bug-bounty platform. It connects ethical hackers and blockchain-based projects to make their system more robust and web3 safer. Immunefi found its product-market fit quickly after launching in late 2020. I joined in 2021 during one of the crypto bull markets, as they were scaling the team and the product to meet the demand.

## Contribution

I worked with Immunefi for a few months to help them with their web development needs, mostly frontend and a little bit of backend. It was one of the few projects were I was sharing the frontend responsibilities with other developers.

I actively contributed to building and improving the bug reporting flow for hackers, with advanced conditional flows, and the admin dashboard for web3 project owners.

## Main Challenge

Immunefi managed to gather a team of talented engineers and designers. The main challenges were not technical but process-related, as it is often the case with fast-growing startups. It was quite demanding to build the features planned in the ambitious roadmap all the while maintaining code quality and keep technical debt under control.

A recipe that worked well was to dedicate on sprint cycle to technical for every three sprint cycles of product development. But even that was challenging, as estimations are hard to get right, and the team was growing fast.

## Results

Overall we managed to stir the product in the direction we wanted, and I am proud of the work we did together. As of 2022, Immunefi was listing the highest bounties in the industry and [paid out $10M to one hacker](https://medium.com/immunefi/wormhole-uninitialized-proxy-bugfix-review-90250c41a43a) in a single bounty for finding a critical in one of [Wormhole](https://wormhole.com/)'s core contracts.
