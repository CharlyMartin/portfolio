## Context

Cofactory is a unique company founded in 2023 by Stanford AI researchers. It stands for "Company Factory" and aims at creating thousands of companies in the next few years leveraging AI both as a tool to build products much faster and as an engine to power the products themselves.

## Contribution

I joined Cofactory as a full-stack engineer a few months after its inception. I worked on one of their first products - an AI writing assistant for structured documents - which is set to become the company's first foundation product for its AI product explorations. My role has been to develop this product from scratch and prepare it for user tests.

## Challenges

Cofactory is a young company with a very ambitious vision, currently in the dynamic phase of finding its product-market fit. As a startup eager to validate its business hypotheses and raise money, moving quickly, shipping regularly, and iterating fast is critical. I believe we've done well in this aspect: Kostantin and I managed to roll out our first product version in just two weeks, following it up with new, improved versions every fortnight.

However, this pace of execution came with its set of issues. Keeping the codebase clean and maintainable, maintaining simplicity and focus on the product, and ensuring the team stays on the same page can become significantly more challenging when the rush is the name of the game.

I've noticed a tendency to equate speed with success in some early-stage startups. Speed without clear direction can create an illusion of progress in the short term, only to create bigger problems down the line. My approach has been to focus on keeping the product streamlined and sticking to our core value proposition while also maintaining a clean and efficient codebase. At times, it's felt like swimming against the current. The famous startup mantra of moving fast and breaking things might have worked a decade ago, but in today's environment, I believe in the _slow is smooth, smooth is fast_ philosophy, valuing consistency and momentum over sheer speed and quick fixes.

On a personal note, I've struggled with a lack of clarity regarding my role. Hired as a full-stack engineer, I often found myself dabbling in product management and mentoring junior developers, with my role shifting week by week. I enjoy these tasks, but the constant change made building momentum in any of them difficult. Reflecting on it, I should have been more proactive in voicing this concern with the leardership team.

## Results

At the end of my contract, I believe I left the product in a good state: a clean codebase with clear conventions and a solid foundation for future development. I also learned a lot about the challenges of working in a startup environment and the importance of clear communication and alignment within the team.

I'm looking forward to seeing how Cofactory takes this first product to market and what other products they will build on top of this one.
