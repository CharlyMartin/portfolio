The challenge was in finding tools they were already familiar with to deploy their website.
There are a lot of solid headless CMS options out there, but they all required some training to use for people who were not that tech saavy. Airtable offered the best of both worlds. It's not a CMS per se, but its spreadsheet-like interface is familiar to most people. Also, there's no publish or versioning. Great features for sure but that would generate friction in the content creation process.

I created a dead-simple UI to make a POST request to Netlify and trigger a new build of the Gatsby app, to take the new content into account.

And voila!
