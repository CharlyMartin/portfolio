## Context

Mayoneese was a fun side-project around one of my long-time passions: music. As a drummer and DJ, I spend a decent amount of time listening to and curating new music, most of which go unnoticed by the mainstream media. Mayoneese was an effort to share these hidden gems and forgotten goodies with the world.

Twice a week for about six months, I sent an email highlighting one piece of music I loved with a link to a music streaming platform. I would briefly explain how I felt listening to this track and why I cared to share it. At its peak, Mayoneese had 200+ subscribers and above 50% email open rates, on average.

I eventually had to pause it for lack of time. The landing page is still live, though it is a bit buggy now. I let the domain name expire, so it's only accessible on Netlify's generic domain now, for posterity.

## Contribution

I created Mayoneese's branding, designed the landing page using Figma, and built it with Gatsby.js. Clients' projects usually looked serious and professional, so it was a fun sandbox for exploring playful and colourful visual identities. I also integrated with Mailchimp to manage my audience.

I was the only one working on the project, though I received a decent amount of music suggestions from subscribers. Thank you all for that!
