## Context

MyStudiolo was a company launched by two art lovers in Paris who were sad to keep track of their beautiful art pieces in a tool as plain as Excel. They couldn't find the tool they dreamed of, so they built it themselves.

My Studiolo's promise was to create a digital version of a _studiolo_ (from the Italian, meaning little studio): a small room, often lavishly decorated, dedicated to reading, studying, and writing.

With a team of 6 people, 2 designers, 3 developers, and 1 lead, we helped them do just that. We delivered a style guide, a design system, a web app, and a landing page for their new venture.

## Contribution

I built the frontend of the web app and the landing page using the component library created by Simon, the other frontend developer on the project. The landing page was a one-pager built with Gatsby, while the web app was a standalone React app. I spent most of my time on the latter, the project's most complex and exciting part.

## Main Challenge

This project's main challenge was to plan and coordinate everyone's work. Our team worked remotely, dealing with 3 time zones: Europe, Canada & Australia. We ran into a few cascading issues at the beginning, where someone was waiting on someone else's work to be able to start.

It was also our first time working together as a team. Most of us were solo freelancers before this project. It took me a few weeks to get into the groove of things, which was a valuable lesson. Clear communication and efficient collaboration are as important as the code you write, if not more.

Finally, I integrated the Stripe API for the first time, which opened my eyes to what a clean and well-documented API can bring to a project. Stripe made implementing a subscription feature in the app easy, even though I had never done it.

## Results

We were pleased with the final results, and so was the client. My Studiolo launched in September 2019 during a release party they organised in Paris with people from the art world.
