## Context

MyStudiolo was a company launched by two art lovers in Paris, who were sad to keep track of beautiful art piece in a tool as plain as Excel. They couldn't find the tool they dreamed of, so they decided to build it themselves. My Studiolo was born.

My Studiolo's promise was to create a digital version of a _studiolo_ (from the Italian, meaning little studio): a small room, often lavishly decorated, dedicated to reading, studying and writing.

With a team of 6 people, 2 designers, 3 developers and 1 lead, we helped them do just do that. We created a style guide, a design system, and a web app and a landing page for their new venture.

## Contribution

I built the front-end of the web app and the landing page using the component library created by Simon, the other front-end developer on the project. The landing was a one-pager built with Gatsby while the web app was a standalone React app. I spent most of my time on the latter, the most complex and interesting part of the project.

## Main Challenge

The main challenge of this project was to to plan and coordinate everyone's work. Everyone in our team was working remotely, and we had to deal with 3 timezones: Europe, Canada & Australia. We ran into a few cascading issues at the beginning, where someone was waiting on someone else's work to be able to start.

It was also our first time working together as a team. Most of us were solo freelancers prior to this project. It took a few weeks to get into the groove of things, which was a valuable lesson for me. Clear communication and efficient collaboration are as important as the code you write, if not more.

Finally, I integrated the Stripe API for the first time, which opened my eyes to what a clean and well-documented API can bring to a project. Stripe made it easy for me to implement a subscription feature in the app, even though I had never done it.

## Results

We were very happy with the final results, and so was the client. My Studiolo launched in September 2019 during a release party they organised in Paris with people from the art world.
