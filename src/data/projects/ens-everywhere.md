## Context

ENS Everywhere is a fun project we built for the [ETHGlobalâ€™s ETHOnline hackathon](https://online.ethglobal.com/) that took place in September 2022. ENS Everywhere allows users on any major L2 to purchase a top-level ENS domain name for up to 30% cheaper than on L1. It does this by bundling multiple domain names into a single operation.

## Contribution

We hacked the whole project in about a week, from ideation to development to pitching it to the judges. I built the frontend of the project in about 1.5 days. I was able to do so thanks to the power of Next.js and Chakra UI. Next allowed me to quickly scaffold the project while Chakra UI gave me all the necessary UI component to quickly put the UI together. Big plus, Chakra's default theme makes it easy to build a beautiful and consistent UI.

## Results

We were picked as one of the finalist projects and pitched the project in front of a jury, some of which were part of the ENS governance. We ended up [winning multiple prizes](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/enseverywhere-q2rvq), including "Best NFT infrastructure" from [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/). Great collaboration with the team and a fun project to work on!
