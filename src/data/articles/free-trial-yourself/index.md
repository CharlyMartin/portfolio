About 6 months ago, I knew little about programming. Today I am the tech guy of a growing coworking brand in Paris. How is that possible? I created the position myself. Here’s the story.

In 2016, I took one of the best decisions in my life: I attended [Le Wagon](https://www.lewagon.com/), a coding bootcamp. After finishing the intense training, I was eager to continue down this learning path. I needed a project to implement my fresh new skills on.

I was facing a choice. I could either work on a side-project of my own: another “Airbnb-like” platform that would end up nowhere as most first projects do; or I could board an existing project with actual users and business issues.

Luckily enough then, a close friend of mine had been launching one of the first co-working cafés in Paris. After a few months of operation, it was booming. He and his co-founder were already looking for expansion.

One night like many, we were talking over the phone. He explained to me how they were about to open up a second workspace in Paris. Their one-page website for their one-venue business would soon become inadequate. So I suggested that I make their website. Like most early stage startup with no funding, money was tight. “Fair enough, I will do it for free!” I said.

## Experience Vs Money

The deal was clear, it would cost them nothing and it would be my first valuable experience as a developer. Back then, I was staying at my parents’ place, money was not an issue in the short-run, but experience was. I chose to focus on the latter.

I was super excited to start off this new project from scratch, to create something of my own that would eventually be used by tens of thousands of people.

Their web application has since been my playground, my code lab where I have tried all sort of stuff, with various outcomes. My backstage experiments have remained transparent to them, they were mostly not even aware of it. The implicit condition was that the website needed to always run seamlessly, and it did. I probably wouldn’t have dared to try out those things had I been under a regular contract.

This freedom has been very stimulating and has led me to go well beyond the initial scope of our deal. I have explored many facets of web development: back-end, design, UX, SEO, deployment, performance, security, DNS, remote collaboration… This project has allowed me to grow my skills steadily, and as my skills grew it benefited the project. Isn’t it the definition of a win-win situation?

Some have argued that the deal is unfair to me. Again, it all depends on where your focus is: money or experience. The market price of developing such a web application is probably around €15k. How much is worth all the experience, visibility and connections I’ve gained thanks to this project? Probably a lot more. Additionally, helping one of my best friends develop the coolest place in Paris is priceless to me.

## Conclusion

Hubsy has been my main source of experience so far. This is a fantastic showcase, I mention it regularly. As long as there will be a room for learning and enough spare time on my side (although l suspect the latter to end first), I’ll keep on being part of this adventure.

So, if you’re new to code and lack experience, I strongly advise you to free trial yourself. Pick a young company you believe in and just start. Your revenue will be the same as if you worked on your own side-project (spoiler: none), but the experience gained will differ tremendously. You have no idea how far you can go when you’re fuelled by passion instead of money. Just remember to enjoy the ride.
